**What is cloud computing

Cloud computing is on demand delivery of computing services such as computer servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence over the Internet so called cloud.This helped enterprises provision the infrastructure in quick time compare to traditional approach where it took months to build and provision an infra in a data center. It eliminates the need for enterprises to procure, configure, or manage resources themselves, and they only pay for what they use and zero or less administration on the infrastructure.

There are three types of cloud computing service models.
1. IaaS ( Infrastrure as a Service): It offers compute and storage services.
2. PaaS ( Platform as a Service) : It offers a develop-and-deploy environment to build cloud apps.
3. SaaS ( Software as a Service) : It delivers apps as services.
